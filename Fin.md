# Finance

I started working in Finance because my PhD scholarship at [ECARES]( http://ecares.ulb.ac.be/) was funded by a Belgian bank interested in econometrics of portfolio credit risk. For that reason most of my doctoral coursework was in mathematical finance and statistics, latter on I learned financial economics while visiting [INSEAD]( https://www.insead.edu/).

Most of my research is based on finding new ways to approach a problem or current topic in finance from a statistical point of view, most of the time this implies coding and an illustrative application.

I am also heavily involved in building an academic and practitioner community in finance in Colombia and Latin America

* In June 2019, we are organizing the [Third International Congress on Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance](http://icasqf2019.icasqf.org/) in Manizales, Colombia. 
* In 2019 we started a new [Master of Finance](http://www.urosario.edu.co/Maestria-en-finanzas/Inicio/) at the faculty. This master is focused on Project Finance and Financial Management
* In 2018 we created the Latin American Society of Quantitative Finance and Actuarial Sciences (SOLACFIN).
* Since 2017, I am very interested in blockchain applications.
* We are launching our new version of the Master in Quantitative Finance in the second semester of 2019.
* In May 2017, I co-organized a seminar on [Longevity Risk]( http://www.urosario.edu.co/Home/Principal/Eventos/Facultad-de-Economia/Conferencia-Riesgo-de-Longevidad-desafios-y-opor/) with AXA-Colpatria and funded by the Institut Français within the Annee France Colombie.
* In 2017, we started a joint bi-monthly finance seminar with various universities in Bogota: CESA, Universidad Javeriana, Universidad de los Andes, Universidad del Rosario. 
* In June 2016, we co-organized [Second International Congress on Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance]( http://icasqf.org/) in Cartagena, Colombia. 
* I have also been heavily involved in reforming our undergraduate and graduate programs in Finance since 2010.
* In June 2014 we co-organized First International Congress on Actuarial Science and Quantitative Finance in Bogota, Colombia. This is a project that Jaime Londoño at the Math department in Universidad Nacional started in 2013. He invited many people interested in quantitative finance.
* Since returning home after my PhD in Belgium (2010), I started working on a [Master in Quantitative Finance]( http://www.urosario.edu.co/Maestria-Finanzas-Cuantitativas/Inicio/). The Master officially begun in 2013.
