# Finance

I started working in Finance because my PhD scholarship at [ECARES]( http://ecares.ulb.ac.be/) was funded by a Belgian bank interested in econometrics of portfolio credit risk. For that reason most of my doctoral coursework was in mathematical finance and statistics, latter on I learned financial economics while visiting [INSEAD]( https://www.insead.edu/).

Most of my research is based on finding new ways to approach a problem or current topic in finance from a statistical point of view, most of the time this implies coding and an illustrative application.

I am also heavily involved in building an academic and practitioner community in finance in Colombia and Latin America
