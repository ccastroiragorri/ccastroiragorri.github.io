# Blockchain

I am currently working on two projects using [Hyperledger frameworks and tools](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects), here is a short description:

## Digital Degree 

A proof of concept (PoC) of a permissioned blockchain for verifiable digital diplomas base on the [Blockcerts](https://www.blockcerts.org/about.html) open standard. Digital diplomas are a transparent way of verifying professional or educational accomplishments for a global workforce and it’s a first step toward supplying the full record of a learning experience (transcripts, projects,..). Blockcerts is an open-source project initially led by MIT’s media lab and Learning Machine. Blockcerts focus has been on issuing the certificates on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Our goal is to extend the certification process in a permissioned blockchain using the Hyperledger framework and tools. The initial aim is to build a ledger of digital diplomas to be deployed for a university and extend its possibilities to other institutions.

## [Blockchain for open science](http://blockchain4openscience.org/)

Blockchain fits the mindset of open science and can help to fulfill open science principles: transparency and availability of blockchain makes scientific outputs open & transparent; disintermediation removes subjectivity from scientific reviews; integrity and possibility to secure transactions in the competing environment increases trust in scientific results; smart contracts allows to manage access to scientific outputs; immutability represents precise relationships between the works with such features as richness, time-based relationships, and logical precursors.

## Learning about Blockchain: Resources

Given the strong interest in blockchain, I decided to learn about it (for personal and academic reasons).  Here are a couple of resources:
