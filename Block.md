# Blockchain

I am currently working on two projects using [Hyperledger frameworks and tools](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects), here is a short description:

## [Blockchain for open science](http://blockchain4openscience.org/)

[Blockchain fits the mindset of open science and can help to fulfill open science principles: transparency and availability of blockchain makes scientific outputs open & transparent; disintermediation removes subjectivity from scientific reviews; integrity and possibility to secure transactions in the competing environment increases trust in scientific results; smart contracts allows to manage access to scientific outputs; immutability represents precise relationships between the works with such features as richness, time-based relationships, and logical precursors.](https://github.com/Blockchain4openscience/B4OS-frontend) 

## Learning about Blockchain: Resources

Given the strong interest in blockchain, I decided to learn about it (for personal and academic reasons).  Here are a couple of resources:
* [Do you need a blockchain? (by Wüst and Gervais, 2017)](http://doyouneedablockchain.com/)
